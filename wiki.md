It is no secret that the United States has a health crisis on its hands.  This is a *threat* to: national security, as just over 1 in 3 adults 17-24 are too heavy to [serve in the military](https://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/downloads/unfit-to-serve-062322-508.pdf); increasing insurance and [hospital operational costs](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11606-016-3968-8); and a laundry list of chronic health problems that are linked to overweight individuals.  There is no secret to what the answer to this issue is: better nutrition and increased physical activity.  This project is focused on incentivizing physical activity in order to prevent and reduce the obesity problem in America.  Below is the methodology.

## What is Get Moving America
Get Moving America is a privatized competition system to encourage users to engage in physical activity of any kind and upload it for real rewards.  There are car insurance companies that provide discounts for safe driving habits, imagine getting a reduction on your health insurance for completing the CDC recommended [150 minutes](https://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/walking/index.htm) of exercise a week.  This project will give users the ability to anonymously add their activity information to their area.  This data can then show trends on exercise in given Companies, Communities, Regions, and States.
### Monetary Rewards
Through different partnerships there could be multiple levels of rewards such as activity trackers, nutrition courses, premium versions of activity tracking apps, etc.  The ultimate goal for rewards would being able to provide users with reduced insurance costs.

### Intangible Rewards
While having a prize at the end of the road can be incentive for enough users, there are intangible results that come with an increase in physical activity.  [Common consequences of obesity](https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/basics/consequences.html) are not only physically damaging, but also emotionally damaging.  With increased risk of heart disease and diabetes to anxiety, depression, and bullying.

## Who is Get Moving America for
Get Moving America is for any adult in America that wants to change the direction of their life and see money coming back into their pockets, with [medical costs rising 14.3 percent](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11606-016-3968-8) for obesity patients.

## Further concepts
Get Moving America would use anonymized data when displaying exercise information on the global heat map and leaderboards for regions and companies.  On a users personal dashboard they would be able to track their own activity and get offers from companies with different rewards for meeting activity levels.  The website would be the middle man that handles the users data so that the partnership companies would not have access to users data but instead would be able to give Get Moving America a product of offer that they want individuals who meet certain criteria to receive.
